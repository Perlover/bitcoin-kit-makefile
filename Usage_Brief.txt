EASY INSTALLATION, LIGHTNING:

After installation you will get compiled from sources and installed under $HOME:

THE MOST FRESH: bitoind + lnd + lncli-web programs

And the necessary fresh accompanying equipment for compilation before (will be
compiled from sources too):

gcc 7.1, python 2 & python3, required fresh some libs (libevent, openssl, boost, sqlite3, zeromq),
golang, nodeJS

This makefile also additionally contains some targets but are yet not documented: ElectrumX server

    Stage 1 (The process takes about 1-2 hours, better to use 'screen'):
	make i-want-lightning
	    My recommended installation: bitcoin core + lnd
	    At the beginning you will be asked about surrent network IP addresses (listen and public).
	    In many cases these ip addresses will be defined automatically.

    Stage 2 (It's very fast process but is interactive one):
	make [ set-up-lightning-mainnet | set-up-lightning-testnet ]
	    This will configure lnd's wallet.
	    You will need to come up with a password and to write 24 words of wallet.
	    It's interactive stage so there will be better if you will run when you will be near from terminal.

    Stage 3:
	To logout from terminal/shell and login again. After you will have all environment variables for normal work.
	And you will have scripts in $PATH for starting/stopping:

	    Start & stop bitcoind + lnd + lncli-web:

	    [mainnet|testnet]-lightning-[start|stop]

		OR

	    [mainnet|testnet]-bitcoind-[start|stop]
	    [mainnet|testnet]-lnd-[start|stop]
	    [mainnet|testnet]-lncli-web-[start|stop]

	You can work with node same way: https://your_listen_ip_address:[8280|8281]/
	The passwords can be found in ~/credentials directory, 8280 - for mainnet, 8281 - for testnet

    After installation to see ~/credentials/* files. After you can remove theirs.
